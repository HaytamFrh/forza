	"step1": "Horizon 5 takes a slightly different approach to filling out your map with races to complete. You'll start with a few easy races in the middle of the map, but will slowly start to unlock Accolade points..",
	"step2": "This is where you'll start the Horizon Festival in Mexico. The Mainstage will introduce you to every type of race and PR Stunt before giving you the opportunity to decide which direction you want to focus on first. .",
	"step3": "When you take things to the jungle, you'll open up dirt races around the map. Finishing this expedition also unlocks the El Camino Story, which sees you following an old explorer to take pictures of ancient ruins .",
	"step4": "Unlike the other Expeditions, this one unlocks all kinds of new things around the map. You'll find new Speed Traps, Danger Signs, Speed Zones, Trailblazer Gates, and Drift Zones scattered around Mexico. Plus, if you want to smash all of the Bonus Boards, you'll need the ramps these Danger Signs unlock. .",
	"step5": "Verification",
	"step6": "When you take things to the street racing scene, it's all about Speed, Handling, and Acceleration. Again, we love using something like the 2011 BMW X5 M Forza Edition .",
	"step7": "Cross Country races can kind of be viewed as the middle ground between Offroad and Street. That means you want something that can do both. .",
